# 10,000 Hours

Many people have heard of Malcolm Gladwell's book -- Outliers which popularized the 10,000 hour rule. The 10,000 hour rule indicates that experts become experts because of massive amounts of deliberate practice. Gladwell makes the case that 10,000 hours seems to be the time period it takes to become an expert.


When I started this coding journey I didn't know where it would take me. I knew about the 10,000 hour rule and decided to keep track of how far I traveled on the journey. First, I just wrote my times on a piece of paper but then I kept going and decided to transfer to a spreadsheet. 10000Hours.ipynb shows my journey of coding across several years. 


For me, coding is any deliberate learning which could include actual coding, watching videos/tutorials, getting environement set up, reading about coding or related topics, etc. Sometimes we get distracted when coding but if I realized I got distracted for any significant amount of time I would subtract an estimated amount off of my coding time. Also, there are plenty of coding times that are not included in these hours.
